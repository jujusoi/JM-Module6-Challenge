## Description

Living in Australia, it's crucial to stay updated on the weather, as temperatures can change dramatically based on the season. As an aspiring web developer, I recognized the need for a quick and easy way to access weather information for different Australian cities. To address this, I created a user-friendly weather dashboard app with no pre-existing foundation, to display weather info to users.

This weather dashboard allows users to select their desired Australian city and instantly view essential weather data such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, the dashboard offers a comprehensive 5-day forecast that outlines upcoming weather conditions.

One standout feature of this dashboard is the dynamic weather images and backgrounds that correspond to the forecast. By utilizing this unique feature, users can easily identify weather patterns instantly. For example, a rainy day will be accompanied by a darker background with a raincloud icon, while a sunny day will feature a bright blue background with a sun icon. This visually engaging approach makes the weather dashboard functional whilst also attributing to its aesthetic.

## Usage

Upon visiting the website, users will be greeted with a header, followed by two main content areas. The first content area features a city name and button, accompanied by a brief overview of weather info on that city. The second content area will display the 5-day forecast for the selected city.

Once users have viewed the city information and the 5-day forecast, they have the option to click on the 'Change City' button located just below the city name and date. This action will open an interactive widget that users can freely move around on the screen. The widget provides two main functions - a city search and city buttons.

With the city search function, users can easily find their desired Australian city by typing its name. The search will offer autocomplete suggestions based on the input, streamlining the process. Additionally, just below the search bar, users will find a list of city buttons. These buttons offer a convenient alternative for users who prefer selecting from a pre-defined list of cities instead of using the search function.

Upon selecting a city using either the search bar or the city buttons, the user's search will be submitted. Once submitted, the main content of the page will be updated automatically, and the city name and forecast areas will be replaced with corresponding information for the newly chosen city.
